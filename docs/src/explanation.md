## Explanation

You probably want to read my blog post about it: [OpenSourc.ES Enigma and Bombe](https://opensourc.es/blog/enigma-and-bombe).
Anyway this page gives you a brief overview:

- The Enigma is a mechanical machine used in WW II by the Germans
- It is a symmetric cipher
- It uses rotors and a plugboard
  - the rotors change the "key" each time a letter is typed
  - the plugboard swaps two letters
- There are an enormous number of possibilities but it can be cracked
- The main flaw is that a letter can't be encoded by itself

This package allows you to encode/decode and crack messages.
