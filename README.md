# Enigma

You'll be able to decode and encode messages like using the [Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)
using this package. Currently a very simple version without a plugboard is implemented.

Additionally you'll be able to crack Enigma codes if you have an encrypted message and some kind of hint like `Wetterbericht` is part of the first 100 characters of the message. 

Ongoing project ;)
